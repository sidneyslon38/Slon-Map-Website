<h1>Car Crashes Decreased Across NYC Since 2020, But Those Numbers May Be Undercounted</h1>

<h3>Between 2020 and 2025, NYC vehicle collisions have largely decreased across most of the city. According to one expert, those numbers may be undercounted.</h3>

    <p>NEW YORK, NY (Dec. 19, 2025) – The past five years have seen a number of changes to New York City roads. Following the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, there was a marked “decline in driving activity,” according to a 2025 driver behavior study published by the New York City Department of Transportation. Since the implementation of congestion pricing in January 2025, Gov. Kathy Hochul’s office reported that “crashes in the congestion relief zone are down 14 percent.” An analysis of car collisions in New York City zip codes between 2020 and 2025 seem to support these statements, though it reveals there is still work to be done in reducing overall crashes citywide.<br>
<br>
Vision Zero, a street safety non-profit that closely works with the Department of Transportation, has already implemented a number of street safety features across the city to reduce collisions and traffic injuries. These include leading pedestrian intervals, speed humps, and turn traffic calming, which involves changing the timing of turn signals and traffic lights. Some boroughs have adopted these safety features better than others. In the Bronx, for example, many zip codes have seen a decrease in collisions since 2020. Parts of Brooklyn and Queens have also done well, with decreases as much as 20-to-30% in neighborhoods like Ridgewood in Queens, and Flatbush or Marine Park in Brooklyn. In Staten Island and Manhattan, however, there are some significant increases in collisions; West Village, Manhattan saw an over 120% increase in car crashes since 2020.<br>

Despite some of these higher zip codes, overall crashes look to have decreased. This may seem like a win for city transit officials, but Alexa Sledge from Transportation Alternatives said that the numbers may be off. “Lots of crashes go under the radar,” she said, citing inconsistency in police data, especially during the pandemic years. Crash data from 2020 “is super wonky because of the pandemic,” she said. 
<br><br>
Overall, 63% of New York City zip codes saw a decrease in car collisions between 2025 and 2020; only 35% of zip codes saw an increase, and 2% reported no change.
